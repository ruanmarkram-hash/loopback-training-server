    Same contract as health metrics: omitted (null) fields never overwrite
    stored values, so an app build that only knows about energy and macros can
    ship alongside one that also reports micronutrients.

    That rule leaves a client unable to retract what it has stopped reporting,
    so `clear` names fields to null explicitly — omission is "no opinion",
    `clear` is "known absent". Without it a value the client no longer stands
    behind (a micronutrient it has since learned is a sparse sum) would
    outlive that decision forever.

    Values are whole-day totals and this overwrites field-by-field, so the
    client must compute them over a *complete* local day. A window whose edge
    lands mid-day would store that day's tail — the mechanism behind the July
    2026 sleep/steps corruption (docs/sleep-data-handoff.md). Days still in
    progress belong here with `partial: true`, which keeps them out of every
    average until a later sync completes them.
